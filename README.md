Guess Who
--- 

Now that you know about scope, and the difference between the let and const keywords, consider each GUESS in task_scope_guesswho_start_code. Use your knowledge to predict what the outcome or error will be.

Make a copy of the start code from GitHub. As ever,do not work in coursenotes.
We suggest that you begin by commenting out ALL the code, apart from the GUESS you are working on.
In a comment below the GUESS, write your predicted outcome.
run the code to see if you're right! node task_scope_guesswho_start_code.js
